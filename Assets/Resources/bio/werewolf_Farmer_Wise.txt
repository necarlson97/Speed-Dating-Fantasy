I've been a farmer all my life. It's a hard life, but it's a good life. I'm a werewolf, so I have to be careful about when I change. I can't let anyone see me, so I have to be careful about where I go. I've been doing this for a long time, and I've gotten pretty good at it. I've got a good pack, and we look out for each other. We're not perfect, but we're family."
