Working this land - it's a hard life, but it's a good life. I have to be careful about when I change, can't let anyone see me. I've been doing this for a long time, and I've gotten pretty good at it. I've got a good pack, and we look out for each other. We're not perfect, but we're family. They are the youth, the energetic ones - I am just there to provide guidance and insight. Sharing the importance of living in harmony with nature, and understanding the natural world and the creatures who inhabit it.
