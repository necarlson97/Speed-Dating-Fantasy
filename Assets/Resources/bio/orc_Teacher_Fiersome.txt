I am a Fiersome Teacher orc. I teach young orcs how to be fierce and strong. I was born in the Mountains of Shadow, and I have lived there my whole life. I love the Mountain, and I would never leave it. I am the best teacher in the Mountain, and I am very proud of that.

I was born into a clan of orc warriors. I was taught how to fight and hunt from a young age. I rose through the ranks of my clan, and eventually became their leader. I led my clan to victory in many battles, and we conquered many lands. I am a fierce and fearsome warrior, and my enemies tremble before me. I have no equal in combat, and I will gladly face any challenger. I am the Fiersome Teacher, and I will teach you how to be a warrior like me."
