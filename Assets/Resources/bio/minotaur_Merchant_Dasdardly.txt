I live a life of luxury. I have everything I could ever want or need, and I enjoy every minute of it. I am surrounded by beautiful things, and I am always able to get whatever I want. Sometimes that means taking advantage of others. Always scheming, always plotting, and always looking for ways to get ahead. I can be ruthless in my dealings, and often make enemies of those who crossed me. But I always manage to come out on top, no matter what.
