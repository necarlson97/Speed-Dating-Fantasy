My work is a family tradition that's been passed down for generations. It takes much care and knowledge to ensure each and every garment is perfect. I always enjoy meeting my clients and hearing their stories. I get to meet so many different types of people from all walks of life and learn about their culture and background. I am always happy to share what I know, and to help others learn.
