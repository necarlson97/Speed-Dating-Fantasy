I have been building things since I was a wee 'un. I am always looking for new and interesting projects to work on. I have built all sorts of things, from homes and castles to bridges and tunnels. I especially love building things that are dangerous or difficult to build. I'm a bit of a daredevil, and I love to take risks - if others get hurt, that's too bad for them!
