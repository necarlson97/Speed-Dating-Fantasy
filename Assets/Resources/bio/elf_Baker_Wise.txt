The Wise Baker elf told me about their life in the fantasy world. They said that they have been living in the world for centuries, and have seen many things change over time. They said that they enjoy living in the world and seeing all the different creatures that live there.

I live in a world of fantasy, where I can be whoever I want to be. I can be as beautiful and as magical as I want, and I can make others believe in me. It's a wonderful place to be, where I can be free to be myself."

My life is simple. I live in the forest and I bake pies. That's all there is to it. I don't have much contact with other people, but that's okay. I like my life just the way it is."
