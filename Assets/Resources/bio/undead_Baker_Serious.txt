I used to make cakes and pies for a living, before the apocalypse. I was pretty good at it too - but now everything's changed. Now I just bake to survive. I don't really enjoy it anymore, but it's a necessary evil. I hope to one day find a cure for this plague and I can return to my life in the kitchen.
