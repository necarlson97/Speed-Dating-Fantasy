I was a Serious Baker before the apocalypse. I used to bake cakes and pies for a living. I was pretty good at it too. But then the zombies came and everything changed. Now I just bake to survive. I don't really enjoy it anymore, but it's a necessary evil. I hope to one day find a cure for this zombie plague and return to my life as a Serious Baker."



I was a baker in life, and now I'm a baker zombie. I love baking, it's my passion. I often get up early in the morning to bake fresh bread or pastries, and I love the smell of baking in the kitchen. I'm always trying new recipes and experimenting with different ingredients. I love to share my baking with others, and I often give baked goods to friends and family. I'm a bit of a perfectionist when it comes to baking, and I always strive to create the perfect bake.

I used to be a Serious Baker, but then I turned into a zombie. Now I just lurch around and moan for brains. It's not a great life, but it's all I've got now."
