I always felt different from other kids. I was withdrawn, and never really fit in. I love how quiet and peaceful our town is. It's a great place to live. One day, everything changed. I was out walking in the forest near our town and I bitten and turned. It was a shock at first, but now I love it. I still have my passions - baking, apple pie especially. Mostly though I have to eat it all myself!
