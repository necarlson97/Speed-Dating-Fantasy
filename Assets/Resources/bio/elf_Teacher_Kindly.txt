I instruct the young elves. I teach them the ways of our people and the magic that we use. I also teach them how to defend themselves against the dark forces that seek to harm us. The children are always so eager to learn and they make me laugh with their innocence. I am blessed to have this job. Most importantly, I hope they become kind and caring people, and they enjoy helping others.
