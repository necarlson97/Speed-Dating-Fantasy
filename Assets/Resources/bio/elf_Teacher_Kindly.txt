I am a teacher of young elves. I teach them the ways of our people and the magic that we use. I also teach them how to defend themselves against the dark forces that seek to harm us. I have been doing this for many years and I enjoy it immensely. The children are always so eager to learn and they make me laugh with their innocence. I am blessed to have this job."



The elf told me about their life in the forest, and how they enjoy teaching others about the ways of magic and nature. They explained that they had been teaching for many years, and that they loved helping others learn about the world around them.

I live in a small village in the woods. I'm a teacher at the local school. I teach the children of the village and help them learn and grow. I also help take care of the animals in the village. I'm a kind and caring person, and I enjoy helping others. I'm also a bit of a dreamer, and I enjoy spending time in nature. I hope to one day travel to other places and see all the wonderful things that the world has to offer."
