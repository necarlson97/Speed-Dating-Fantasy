I was different than the others - I was born with a sense of humor! The others would always look at me funny, but I didn't care. My parents didn't know what to do with me, but they loved me and allowed me to be myself. I eventually left heaven and joined the Navy. I found my true calling in making people laugh. I've been sailing the seas and making people laugh for years
