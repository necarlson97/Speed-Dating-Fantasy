I was born to a family of angels, but I was different than the others. I was born with a sense of humor. The other angels would always look at me funny, but I didn't care. I knew that I was special and that I had a gift.

My parents didn't know what to do with me, but they loved me and allowed me to be myself. I grew up making the other angels laugh. It was my calling.

I eventually left the angel world and joined the Navy. I found my true calling in making people laugh. I've been sailing the seas and making people laugh for years



I met a comedic sailor angel who told me about their life. They said that they loved the sea and the adventures that came with it. They also loved making people laugh and bringing joy to others. It sounded like they had a great life full of excitement and happiness.

I was born on the open sea, and I've been sailing ever since. I've seen the world from the deck of my ship, and I wouldn't trade it for anything. I love the wind in my sails, and the waves crashing against the hull. It's the best life I could ask for."
