I make cunning traps and devices to make other fairies' lives miserable - or houses that fall apart and roads that lead nowhere. It's my job and I love it! My favorite thing to do is to sneak up on unsuspecting fairies and give them a good scare. I also love to make people believe crazy things. It's all in good fun, of course. I just love to cause mischief and mayhem!
