I am a coward builder minotaur. I am too afraid to build anything, so I just sit here all day."I am a Cowardly Builder minotaur. I was born into a family of builders, but I was always too afraid to work with my hands. I would much rather stay in my comfortable home and read books all day. My family always tells me that I'm not a true builder because I'm not brave enough to work with my hands, but I don't care. I'm happy just the way I am."I am a cowardly builder minotaur. I'm not very good at fighting, so I usually just stay out of combat. I prefer to build things, and I'm quite good at it. I'm also quite cowardly, so I tend to avoid dangerous situations.
