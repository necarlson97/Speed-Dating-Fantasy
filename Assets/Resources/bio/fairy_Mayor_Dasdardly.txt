I'm the Dasdardly Mayor fairy! I'm in charge of this town and I love it! I've been the mayor for years, and I love helping people! I love making sure that everyone is happy and safe, and that they have what they need! I'm always here to help, and I love making sure that everyone is happy!"

I'm the Mayor of a small town called Dasdardly. I'm always busy trying to make sure the town runs smoothly. I don't have much time for fun, but I love spending time with my family and friends. I'm always looking for ways to help out my community, and I love to see people smile.



The Dasdardly Mayor Fairy is a very sneaky and cunning creature. They love to play tricks on people and make them look foolish. They are also very greedy and will do anything to get their hands on something they want.
