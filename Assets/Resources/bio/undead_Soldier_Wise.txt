I was a soldier, I fought for my country. I was a good soldier, I did my duty. But then I was wounded, and I died. I was resurrected as a zombie, and now I fight for the undead. I'm a different kind of soldier now, but I'm still a soldier."



I was a soldier in the army. I fought in many battles and saw many things. I was a wise and experienced soldier, and I had many stories to tell. But now I'm a zombie, and all I can do is moan and groan. I miss being alive and being able to talk to people.

I was a soldier, I fought for my country. I was a good soldier, I followed orders. I was a brave soldier, I never backed down from a fight. I was a loyal soldier, I always stuck by my comrades. But in the end, I was just a zombie."
