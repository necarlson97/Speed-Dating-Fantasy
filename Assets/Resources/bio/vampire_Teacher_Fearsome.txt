I've taught many students, both human and vampire. I want to teach forever. I've gotten into quite a few scrapes - I'm not sure if there's anything that can surprise me anymore. Like it or not, my legend has spread - they have heard of my killing prowess. I am feared by many, but I enjoy the company of my students and the challenge of teaching them.
