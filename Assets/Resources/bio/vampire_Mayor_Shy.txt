I'm not used to talking to people, but I enjoy spending time with my friends and family. I don't like to talk about myself, I can be a very private person. I do have a dark secret, a dark thirst, that I can't tell anyone about. Despite this, I do keep getting elected for more terms - I think it's because I'm a good listener and I have a lot of patience. I'm also very honest and fair, which I think people appreciate.
