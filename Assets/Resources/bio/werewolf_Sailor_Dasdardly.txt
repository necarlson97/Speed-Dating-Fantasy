I was born in the year of the dog. raised  in a coastal town in the middle of nowhere. I've seen a lot of strange things out there, and I've killed my fair share of monsters. But nothing has prepared me for what I would become. they call me 'Wicked'. I'm always getting into trouble, and my naval superiors never knew what to do with me. Eventually, they just gave up and started calling me by that name.
