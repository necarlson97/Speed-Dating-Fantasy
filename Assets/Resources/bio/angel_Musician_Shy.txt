I started playing the piano when I was five years old and the violin when I was eight. I was always shy growing up, so music was my way of expressing myself. I've been in a few bands, but I'm mostly a solo artist. I don't perform live very often, but I love making music and I hope to continue doing it for the rest of my life.
