I was born into a family of musicians, so music has always been a part of my life. I started playing the piano when I was five years old and the violin when I was eight. I was always shy growing up, so music was my way of expressing myself. I went to college for music education and now I teach music to elementary school students. I love seeing the joy that music brings to people's lives."

I've always loved music, ever since I was a little kid. I started playing the piano when I was five years old and I haven't stopped since. I've been in a few bands, but I'm mostly a solo artist. I'm shy, so I don't perform live very often, but I love making music and I hope to continue doing it for the rest of my life."



I met a shy musician angel, they talked about their life:

"I've always loved music, but I never really pursued it as a career. I always shy away from the spotlight and prefer to be behind the scenes. But recently, I've been thinking about trying to make a go of it as a professional musician.

"It's been a tough road so far, and I've had to make a lot of sacrifices, but I'm starting to see some success. I'm just hoping that I can keep it up and make a living doing what I love."
