I'm the Mayor of Comedy Hell, and it's my job to make sure that everyone here is laughing. It's a tough job, but someone has to do it. I've been doing this job for centuries, and I've seen a lot of changes in the comedy world. But one thing that has always stayed the same is the importance of laughter. Laughter is the best medicine, and it's also the best way to deal with the stresses of life. That's why I'm always working to make sure that everyone in Comedy Hell is laughing.
