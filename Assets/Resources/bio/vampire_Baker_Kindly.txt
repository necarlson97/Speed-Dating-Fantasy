When I was younger, I was very interested in the dark arts and began practicing blood magic. I always stick to feeding on animals, but sometimes I do crave human blood. It's hard to resist the temptation sometimes, but it is what I must do to protect others. Usually I am misunderstood and feared by humans - but all I want is to see others smile. I am learning to make cookies and brownies to make others happy.
