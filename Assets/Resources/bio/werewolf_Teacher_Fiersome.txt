My life as a Fiersome Teacher werewolf has been pretty good, all things considered. I've been able to help a lot of people and make a difference in their lives. It's been a lot of work, but it's been worth it.

I know that not everyone understands what it means to be a werewolf, but that's okay. I'm not here to force anyone to believe anything. I'm just here to help people and make a difference however I can.

I was born in the small town of Beacon Hills and raised by a single mother. I never knew my father, and my mother died when I was very young. I was raised by my grandparents, who were werewolves. I never knew anything about my werewolf side until I was sixteen.

I was out with my friends one night when I was attacked by a group of vampires. I would have been killed if my friends hadn't intervened. They managed to get me to safety, but I was badly injured. My friends took me to see a doctor, who told me that I had been bitten by a werewolf.




My life as a Fiersome Teacher werewolf is pretty great! I get to teach kids during the day and then turn into a powerful werewolf at night. It's a lot of fun and I really enjoy it. I wouldn't change it for anything.
