I was born in Wolfendale - I never knew my parents, they died when I was very young in a car accident, so I was taken in by the pack. I was elected two years ago and have been doing my best to make it a better place for all of us. I absolutely love it. It's a great town, and the people are really friendly. I'm just trying my best to make sure everyone is happy and healthy.
