I was born in the small town of Wolfendale. I never knew my parents, they died when I was very young in a car accident. I was raised by my grandparents and grew up in a very loving home. I always knew I wanted to be a werewolf and when I was eighteen, I finally became one.

I moved to the big city and started my own law practice. I met my mate, who is also a werewolf, and we have been very happy together. I was elected mayor of our town two years ago and have been doing my best to make it a better place for all of us.


I was born in the town of Wolfsbane, raised by a pack of werewolves. When I turned eighteen, I became the mayor of Wolfsbane. I've been mayor for the past ten years, and I absolutely love it. It's a great town, and the people are really friendly. I haven't had any problems with werewolves in years."



The werewolf told me that they had been living in the town for a long time, and that they enjoyed being the mayor. They said that they liked helping people and making sure that the town was a safe place to live.
