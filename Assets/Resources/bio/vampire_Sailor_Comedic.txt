I was born at sea and died at sea I've been hunting prey for centuries, and in that time I've seen and done things that would make even the most experienced swashbuckler blush! I'm a bit of a jokester, so I like to keep things light and fun. I've seen things that would make your hair stand on end, and I've done things that would make your blood run cold. But I'm still here, and I'm still laughing!
