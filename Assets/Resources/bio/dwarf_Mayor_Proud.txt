I have been in office for many years, and during that time, I have seen my town grow and prosper. I am proud to say that I have made a difference in the lives of many. My father was a prominent member of the city guard, and my mother was a well-respected member of the city council. I was elected by a landslide, and have been serving my term ever since.
