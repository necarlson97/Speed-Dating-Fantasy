I was born in the fiery pits, and ever since then I've been climbing up the ranks of the merchant devils. I've been cheated, lied to, and stolen from, but I always come out on top in the end. I enjoy challenge of bargaining and haggling with customers, and the feeling of satisfaction when I manage to get a good deal. I have learned a lot about people, and I know how to get what I want from them. I like the independence that comes with being a merchant, and enjoyed being my own boss.
