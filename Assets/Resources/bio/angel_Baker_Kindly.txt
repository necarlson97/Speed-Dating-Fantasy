My family is very religious, and I was raised to be a good, kind person. I always tried to help others, and I was always drawn to helping those in need. I love to see the smile on their faces when they take a bite of my cakes or cookies. I am so blessed to be able to do what I love, and I hope to continue doing it for many years to come.
