I was born in the jungle, where life is tough and only the strong survive. I was the runt of my litter, but I was determined to make something of myself. When I was old enough, I left the jungle and started working as a tailor.

I'm not the best tailor in the world, but I'm good enough to make a living. I'm shy and introverted, so I don't talk to many people. But I enjoy my work and I'm happy with my life."

I'm a Shy Tailor devil. I sew clothes for a living. I'm not very good at socializing, so I don't talk to people much. I'm a bit of a loner, but I like my work."

I'm a tailor devil. I make clothes for people. I'm shy because I don't like to talk to people. I'm not very good at talking to people. I'm just a shy person."
