As kids, we used to practice in my garage and play shows around the area. Eventually, I started to notice that I was changing. I would get more energy when I was on stage and my senses would become more acute. I could hear things better and my sense of smell was incredibly strong... I also started to crave raw meat. Anyways, being creative is my passion. When I'm not playing, I'm painting, or writing. I'm now more in touch with my primal side, more than I've ever been.
