I'm very serious about my small town and take great pride in serving my community. My duty is to put the safety of my people first. I am always looking out for signs of danger and am quick to act to keep my village safe. I am also responsible for maintaining the peace and order in my village - I often use my magic to do so. My people know that they can always count on me to keep them safe and sound.
