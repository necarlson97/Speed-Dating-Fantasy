I am a simple merchant, I travel around the world selling and buying goods. I don't have much of a story, but I enjoy my life. I'm always on the lookout for new and interesting things to add to my collection."



I was born in a small village in the forest. I grew up helping my parents with their work, gathering food and firewood, and caring for the animals. When I was old enough, I left home to start my own life. I've been travelling ever since, selling my wares in town after town. I've seen a lot of different places and met a lot of different people, but I always feel most at home in the forest.

I am a simple merchant, I travel from town to town selling my wares. I don't have much to say because my life is quite boring."
