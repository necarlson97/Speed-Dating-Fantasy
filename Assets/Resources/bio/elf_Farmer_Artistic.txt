I craft and I live off the land. I am one with nature, and I find beauty in all things. I see the world through a different lens. I am a dreamer, and I believe that anything is possible. I work whenever I find a ranch that needs extra hands. I care for the land, but I don't stay in one place for too long. I like to move around and see new places. I'm always searching for new inspirations for my art.
