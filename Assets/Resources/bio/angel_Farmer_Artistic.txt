I've always loved working with my hands and being outdoors. I enjoy being able to work with the earth and see the fruits of my labor grow and thrive. It's a very gratifying and rewarding way to live. I now run a small place where I grow a variety of crops and also sell my art. I love being able to combine my two passions, and I feel very lucky to be able to do what I love for a living.
