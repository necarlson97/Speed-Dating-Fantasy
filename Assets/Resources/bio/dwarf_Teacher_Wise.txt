I've seen and done things that most people can only dream of. I've traveled to the ends of the world and back. I've also seen the best and worst of humanity, and I've learned a lot from both. I've also had the opportunity to meet many interesting people, including the 5 sage teachers. I've learned a lot from them, and I'm grateful for their wisdom. I help others learn from my experiences.
