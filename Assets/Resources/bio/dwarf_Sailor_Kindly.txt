Aye, I've been on these seas for nigh on fifty years now. I started as a cabin boy and worked my way up. I've seen a lot of things in my time, both good and bad. But I always try to help those in need, even if they're not onboard my ship. That's just the kind of person I am. I'm glad to help others, even if they don't always appreciate it. I'm also a bit of a dreamer, and I hope to make a difference in the world. Thank you for talking to me.
