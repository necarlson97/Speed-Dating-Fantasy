I'm a farmer vampire. I've been farming for centuries. I'm really old. I've seen a lot of things in my time. I've seen the rise and fall of empires. I've seen the birth and death of stars. I've seen the universe itself change and grow. And through it all, I've kept farming.

It's a good life. It's a simple life. But it's a good life. I wouldn't trade it for anything.

I was born in the early 1800s in a small village in Romania. I was always drawn to the dark, and when I was turned into a vampire, it was like coming home. I've been a vampire for over 200 years now, and I love it. I love the power, the darkness, the blood. It's everything I ever wanted."



The vampire farmer told me that they have been farming for centuries, and that it is a very rewarding life. They said that they enjoy the challenge of working the land and that they love the satisfaction of seeing their crops grow. They also said that they enjoy the company of other vampires, and that they have a great sense of community.
