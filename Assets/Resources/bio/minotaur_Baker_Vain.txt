I am a baker by trade, but my true passion is vanity. I love nothing more than looking at myself in the mirror and admiring my reflection. I spend hours every day grooming myself and making sure I look my best.

I love to dress up in beautiful clothes and jewelry, and I love to show off my wealth and status. I want everyone to know that I am the best baker in town, and that I am the most beautiful creature they will ever lay eyes on.

I know that some people think that I am vain and selfish, but I don't care. I am happy with who I am, and I love my life."I've always been interested in baking, ever since I was a young minotaur. I love the creativity that goes into it, and the satisfaction of creating something delicious. I've always been pretty good at it too- my friends and family always told me so.

I started out baking simple things like cookies and cakes, but eventually I started experimenting with more complex recipes. I love coming up with new flavor combinations and trying out new techniques. I'm always trying to learn more and improve my skills.

People started to take notice of my baking, and I started getting requests to make things for special occasions. I was thrilled that people liked my baking so much, and I loved being able to make something that made people happy.

Eventually, I decided to start my own baking business. I quit my job, rented a kitchen, and started baking full-time. It's been a lot of hard work, but it's been so worth it. I love being my own boss and doing something I'm passionate about.

I still love experimenting in the kitchen, and I'm always trying to come up with new and exciting recipes. I want my customers to know that they can always expect something new and delicious from me.
