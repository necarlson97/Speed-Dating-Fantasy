I love the land, the animals, the hard work. I'm always looking for new ways to express myself, and I love to share my work with others. I've been sculpting in my free time. I find that it helps me to relax and to express my creative side. I have sold some of my claywork, and it is always gratifying to know that others appreciate my work.
