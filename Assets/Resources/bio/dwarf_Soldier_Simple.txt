I was born into a clan of miners, and my life has been spent in the dark caverns beneath the mountains. I am a simple soldier, and I fight for my clan and for my king. I have no great ambitions, and I am content to live a simple life.

I was born into a clan of warriors, raised to fight and die for my people. I have fought in many battles, and seen many friends and kin fall in combat. It is a hard life, but it is all I know. I will fight and die for my clan, and for my honor."



I'm just a simple soldier, doing what I'm ordered to do. I don't really have much of a life outside of my duty. I don't mind, though. I'm happy to serve my kingdom and protect my people.
