I was born into a clan of miners, and my life has been spent in the dark caverns beneath the mountains. I fight for my clan and for my king. I have no great ambitions, and I am content to live as I do. I was raised to fight and die for my people. I have fought in many battles, and seen many friends and kin fall in combat. It is a hard life, but it is all I know.
