I met a Proud Sailor devil, they talked about their life. They said that they loved the sea and the adventure that came with it. They also said that they were proud of their work and the camaraderie that came with being a sailor.

I was born in the port city of Charleston, South Carolina. My father was a ship's captain and my mother was a teacher. I joined the Navy when I was 18 and served for 20 years. I saw the world and had some amazing experiences. I retired from the Navy as a Senior Chief Petty Officer.

I'm proud of my service to my country and I'm proud of the life I've led. I've been fortunate to have a great family and to have had some amazing experiences. I'm looking forward to the next chapter in my life and to continued success."

I am a sailor, I've been sailing the seven seas for years. I've seen many things and experienced many adventures. I am proud of my life and my accomplishments."
