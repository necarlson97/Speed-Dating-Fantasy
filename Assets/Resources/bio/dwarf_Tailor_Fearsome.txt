I was born and raised in the mountains of Dunfarr, and it's been my home ever since. I've always been fascinated by the art of sewing, and I eventually learned how to do it myself. I've been making clothes for my fellow dwarves for years, and I've even made a few outfits for humans and other races. I always try to make the best possible product. I recently started branching out into making armor, and I've been having a lot of success with it. I really enjoy the challenge of creating something that's both functional and stylish. I'm very protective of their work, and always quick to defend it against any criticism - if you know what I mean!
