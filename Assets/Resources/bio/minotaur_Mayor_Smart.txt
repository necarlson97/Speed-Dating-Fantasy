I was born in the city of Smart, which is located in the middle of the labyrinth. I grew up surrounded by the endless maze, and it wasn't until I was elected mayor that I realized there was more to life than just the labyrinth.

Now I spend my days exploring the city, meeting new people, and learning about all the different cultures that make up the world. I'm also working on making Smart a more welcoming place for all creatures, regardless of whether they come from the labyrinth or not."I was elected as the Smart Mayor of my village because of my wisdom and intelligence. I am responsible for the well-being of my people, and I take my role very seriously. I am always looking for ways to improve the lives of my constituents, and I am always working to make my village a better place. I am proud to serve as the Smart Mayor, and I will do everything I can to make my village the best it can be."I was born in a small village in the middle of nowhere. I was the runt of the litter and was always picked on by the other minotaurs. When I was old enough, I left my village and set out to find my place in the world. I eventually made my way to the city, where I met the mayor. He was impressed by my determination and offered me a job as his assistant. I've been working for him ever since.

As the mayor's assistant, I help him with his duties and responsibilities. I also help keep the city running smoothly. I'm always on the lookout for ways to make the city a better place for everyone.
