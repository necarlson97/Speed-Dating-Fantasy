I was born in the wrong era. I should have been born a couple hundred years ago, when black flags ruled the waves. Nowadays, people just don't appreciate the art of sailing. I love the freedom - I can go where I want, when I want. I don't have to answer to anyone. I can just enjoy the simple pleasure of being out on the open sea. I've also seen the dark side of the sea, and the things that people do to each other - what I've done.  Let's hope deadmen tell no tales...
