The Wise Tailor told me that they have been living for centuries, and that they have seen many different cultures and societies during their lifetime. They said that they have always enjoyed helping people, and that they enjoy working with their hands. They also said that they are very patient, and that they love to teach people new things.



The tailor angel said that they had a very fulfilling life, full of creativity and joy. They loved helping others look their best and feel confident in their appearance. They felt that their work was a true labor of love.



"I was born in a small town in upstate New York. I always loved sewing and creating things, so when I was old enough, I apprenticed with a local tailor. I learned so much from her and eventually opened my own shop.

I've always enjoyed helping people look their best, and I feel like I'm doing something worthwhile when I help someone find the perfect outfit. I love being a tailor and hope to do it for many years to come."
