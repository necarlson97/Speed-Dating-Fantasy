I've been raised in the ways of the Horde. As a young orc, I was apprenticed, and I learned the trade well. I've always been a bit of a misfit, though. I was never quite like the other orcs. I was always more interested in creative pursuits like sewing and fashion. Still though, who doesn't like a little pillaging and fighting!
