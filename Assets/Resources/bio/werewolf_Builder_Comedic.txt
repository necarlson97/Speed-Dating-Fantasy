I have a natural talent for making people howl with laughter. I often use my powers of comic relief to diffuse tense situations and to make people forget their troubles, even if just for a little while. I make stuff for a living, it's what I do. I've always been good with my hands. If a full moon's out, you'll see me with my hammer, working away.
