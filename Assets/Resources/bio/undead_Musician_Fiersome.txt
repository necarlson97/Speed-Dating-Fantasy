I was a musician before I turned into a zombie. I used to play the trumpet in a band. We would travel around and play at different venues. I miss being able to play music. It was my passion."

I was a musician before I died. I played the cello in a symphony. I was really good at it too. Now, I just play for the zombies. It's not the same, but it's still fun."

I was a musician before I died. I played in a band and we toured all over the world. We were really good and people loved our music. But then the zombie apocalypse happened and everything changed. I died and came back as a zombie, but I still loved music. I would go out and find other zombies to play with, and we would make music together. It was a way to connect with other zombies and to feel alive again. I miss playing music with my band, but I'm glad I can still enjoy it in some way."
