I was born in 17th century Transylvania. I moved to England in the early 1800s, and started working as a merchant. I've been a vampire for about 200 years now. I'm very old, and I've seen a lot in my lifetime. I've always been a bit of a loner, and I prefer to stick to myself. I'm not really looking for companionship, but I don't mind talking to people. I'm just trying to make my way in the world and get by."



The Dasdardly Merchant vampire told me about their life as a vampire. They said that they had been a vampire for many years, and that they had been a merchant in their previous life. They said that they had been very successful in their business, but that they had eventually turned to bloodthirsty murder to sustain themselves. They said that they enjoyed killing people, and that they found it very exhilarating. They also said that they were willing to do whatever it took to get what they wanted, and that they would stop at nothing to get their prey.

I was born in the city of merchants, where everyone is out for themselves. I learned quickly that the only way to get ahead was to take what I wanted, by any means necessary. I quickly rose to power, and became the most successful merchant in the city.

People were afraid of me, but they also respected and admired my wealth and power. I had everything I could ever want... except for eternal life.

I heard rumours of a powerful vampire who lived in the city, and I decided to track him down. I offered him a deal: my wealth and power in exchange for his immortality. He agreed,
