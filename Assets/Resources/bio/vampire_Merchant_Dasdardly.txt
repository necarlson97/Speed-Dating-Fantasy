Before, people were afraid of me - they respected and admired my wealth and power. I had everything I could ever want... except for eternal life. But now? I've been trading for... over 200 years. I'm very old! I get quite bloodthirsty, and enjoy the occasional murder to sustain myself. It's great fun killing people, very exhilarating. I will stop at nothing to get my prey.
