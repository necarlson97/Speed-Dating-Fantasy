I'm a Kindly Tailor fairy. I make clothes for the good fairies and sometimes the bad ones too. I don't mind who I make clothes for, as long as they're happy with what I make for them.

I live in the forest with the other fairies. We help each other out and look after each other. It's a nice place to live.

I've been making clothes for as long as I can remember. It's something I'm good at and I enjoy doing it.

I hope to continue making clothes for as long as I can. It's a part of who
