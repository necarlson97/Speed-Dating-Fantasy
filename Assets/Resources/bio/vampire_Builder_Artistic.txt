As a child, I would often spend my nights painting or sculpting with blood, and I developed a strong passion for it. Over the years, I have honed my skills and become a master builder. I have constructed some of the most beautiful and intricate structures in the darkworld. I don't age, and I don't need to eat or sleep - I just do what I love."
