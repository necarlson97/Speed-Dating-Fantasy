I am a Brave Soldier fairy. I fight for what is right and I will never give up. I have seen many things in my life, and I have been through a lot. I am not afraid to die, because I know that I am doing what is right. I will never forget the things that I have seen, and I will never forget the people that I have met. I will never forget the friends that I have made, and I will never forget the enemies that I have fought. I am a Brave Soldier fairy, and I will never give up."

When I was younger, I wanted to be a soldier. I wanted to protect my country and its people. I was brave and I was strong. I had many friends, but I was always the one who was different. I was always the one who wanted to fight.

"I joined the army and I fought in many wars. I was wounded many times, but I never gave up. I never stopped fighting for my country. I am a brave soldier and I am proud of it."

I was born to fight and die. It's all I've ever known."
