I like to build things, but I don't like to talk to people. I'm not really sure why, I just don't. I live in a cave by myself and I'm happy with that. I don't need anyone else. Usually, I am too afraid to build anything, so I just sit here all day. I would much rather stay in my cozy cave and read books. I'm happy just the way I am.
