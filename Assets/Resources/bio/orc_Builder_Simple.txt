I am a builder. I help my tribe construct our homes and buildings. It is a simple life, but a good one. I am content to live here in our village, surrounded by my friends and family."

I'm a Simple Builder orc. I build things."

I was born into a clan of builders. We were tasked with constructing and maintaining the great orcish city of Orgrimmar. I learned the ways of my people and excelled in my craft. I take great pride in my work, and I enjoy nothing more than seeing a project through from start to finish.

I have worked on some of the most iconic structures in Orgrimmar, including the Thunder Bluff elevators and the great Gates of Orgrimmar. I am a master of my craft, and I take great satisfaction in knowing that my work will stand the test of time.
