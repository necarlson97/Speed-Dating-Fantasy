As a child, I would often sneak into my father's workshop and play with his tools and fabrics. I wanted to be able to provide for my family. However, I was taken in by the vampire who killed my parents and he raised me as his own. He taught me how to hunt, how to kill, and how to make my own clothing. I do what I must to survive, that is all.
