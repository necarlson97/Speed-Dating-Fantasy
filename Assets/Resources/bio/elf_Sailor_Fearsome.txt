I have seen many wonders and traveled to many places. I have fought in many battles and killed many foes. I will sail the seas until the day I die. My parents died in a shipwreck. I was rescued by a group of friendly dolphins who took me in and raised me as one of their own. I learned to swim and hunt with them, and when I was old enough, I left them to start my own life. I've never met a creature I couldn't outswim or outfight. I'm the fiercest on the seven seas, and I'm not afraid of anything.
