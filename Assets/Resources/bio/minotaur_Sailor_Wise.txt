I have many stories to tell. I grew up on the island of Minos,but I left home when I was young to explore the world and learn what else was out there. I quickly learned that there was a lot more to life than what I had experienced on my small island. I've seen amazing things and met interesting people from all corners of the globe. One of the things that I've come to realize is that life is how short it is. Hopefully, I can continue on the helm for many years to come."
