I travel around and perform at different venues. I love making people laugh, and I love music, so it's the perfect job for me. I've been doing it for years, and I love it. It's a great way to make a living. It's just so amazing to see the different reactions from different crowds. Some people just don't get it, but that's okay. I'm just happy to be doing what I love.
