I was born into a military family, so it was only natural. Nothing has been more rewarding than helping keep the peace. It's not always the most glamorous job, but someone has to do it - I'm just happy that I can be of service to my community. When I was of age, I joined the village militia to help protect my town from raiders. There is great camaraderie among us, and we are always there for one another.
