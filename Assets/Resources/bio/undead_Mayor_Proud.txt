I did my best to keep my town safe, but in the end, it was overrun. I'm glad I was able to help my people as best I could, but I wish I could have done more. It wasn't my fault - I was the best in the country, but it doesn't matter now anyway. If only I had more power, I know I have what it takes to set things right.
