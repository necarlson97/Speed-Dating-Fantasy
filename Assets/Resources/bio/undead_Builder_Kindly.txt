I was a builder before the outbreak. I built houses for people. I liked my job. It was a good job. I liked helping people. But then the outbreak happened and everything changed. I became a zombie. I don't remember much after that. I just remember the hunger. The never-ending hunger. I crave human flesh. I will do anything to get it. I don't care about anything else anymore. Just the hunger.

I was a builder before the zombie apocalypse. I built houses for people. It was a lot of work, but I loved it. I miss being able to help people and make their homes beautiful. Now, I just wander around aimlessly, looking for brains to eat. It's not a great life, but it's all I have now."

I was a builder before the outbreak. I was working on a construction site when the outbreak happened. I was bitten by a zombie and turned into one of them. I don't remember much after that, but I do know that I crave human flesh. I will do anything to get my hands on it."
