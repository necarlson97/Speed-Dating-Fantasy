I'm a Artistic Baker, so I spend my days creating beautiful cakes and pastries. I love my work, and I feel very lucky to be able to do what I love for a living.

I think the best part of being a baker is the satisfaction of seeing people enjoy my creations. It's always nice to see people's faces light up when they take a bite of one of my cakes or pastries. It's like I'm giving them a little bit of happiness, and that's the best feeling in the world."

I am a Artistic Baker fantasy dwarf. I enjoy creating beautiful things with sugar and flour. I also like to sing and dance. I am very short, only about three feet tall. I have a beard and long hair. I am very strong for my size. I live in a small village in the mountains. I am happy with my life and enjoy every day."

I was born in the mountains, in a small village near the base of the great peak. My parents were both dwarfs, and I was the only child. I grew up surrounded by the beauty of the mountains, and the love of my family.

As a child, I loved to bake. I would help my mother in the kitchen, and she would teach me all her secrets. I would watch, fascinated, as she created delicious pies and pastries. I knew that one day I wanted to be a baker like her.

When I was sixteen, I left home to apprentice with a master baker in the city
