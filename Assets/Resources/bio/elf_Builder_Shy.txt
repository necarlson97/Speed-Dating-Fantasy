I grew up playing in the trees and making things out of leaves and sticks. When I was old enough, I started helping my parents build houses in the forest. I learned how to use a hammer and saw, and I loved the smell of fresh-cut lumber. I don't really talk to people much, but I like to listen to them. I don't really have any friends, but that's okay because I like spending time by myself. I'm not really sure what else to say, but thanks for talking to me.
