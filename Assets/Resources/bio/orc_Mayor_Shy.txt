Growing up, I never really talked to anyone outside of my family. When I was old enough, I joined the village militia to help protect my home from raiders. I eventually became the captain of the militia, and then the mayor of the village. I've been leading the community for years now, trying to help. I don't talk to many people, but I'm happy with my life here.
