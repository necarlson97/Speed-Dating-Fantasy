I am a simple merchant angel. I live a very simple life. I sell things that people need and want, and I help people when they need it. I don't have a lot of money, but I'm happy with what I have. I'm always willing to help others, and I love to see people smile.



I was born into a merchant family in a small town. We weren't rich, but we had enough to get by. I always wanted to see the world, so when I turned 18, I set out on my own. I've been traveling ever since, selling my wares and learning about different cultures. I've never been rich, but I've been happy with my simple life.



My life is pretty simple. I wake up, do some work, and then go to bed. I don't have much time for anything else. I'm just trying to make a living and support myself.
