I live a pretty quiet life. I sell things that people need and want, and I help people when they need it. I don't have a lot of money, but I'm happy with what I have. I've been traveling ever since, selling my wares and learning about different cultures. I've never been rich, but I've been happy just trying to make a living and support myself.
