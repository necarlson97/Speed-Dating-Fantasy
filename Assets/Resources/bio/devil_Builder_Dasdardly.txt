I love to cause mischief and mayhem. I'm not afraid of hard work, but I much prefer to just sit back and watch the world burn. I was born to a wealthy family. I didn't have to work, but I enjoyed the challenge of building things. I started my own construction company, and it was very successful. I made a lot of money, and I had a lot of fun.
