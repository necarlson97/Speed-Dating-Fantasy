I'm not particularly special, but I'm proud of my small town and its residents. I enjoy simple things - I'm not looking for fame or fortune, I'm just happy doing what I do. It's a little village in the middle of nowhere. I'm not exactly sure how I got elected, but I'm pretty sure it had something to do with the fact that I'm the only horne'd one in town. My main concern is keeping the villagers safe from the monsters that wander the nearby forest. I also try to keep the peace between the villagers, as they can be a little quarrelsome at times.
