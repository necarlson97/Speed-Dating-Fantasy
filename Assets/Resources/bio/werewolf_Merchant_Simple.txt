I'm a Simple Merchant werewolf. I travel from town to town, selling my wares. I don't have much of a home, just a small shack in the woods where I keep my things. I'm always on the move, looking for new customers and new places to sell my goods.

I don't have much in the way of family or friends, just the occasional fellow traveler that I meet on the road. I'm a solitary creature, but I don't mind. I'm used to being alone and I like it that way.
