I joined the Army when I was 18 years old. I was a proud soldier, and I served my country for four years. I was honorably discharged, and I now work as a security guard. I'm proud of my service, and I'm proud of the things I've accomplished."

I joined the Army when I was just eighteen. I thought it would be a great way to see the world and serve my country. I never imagined that I would be deployed to so many different places, or that I would see so much violence.

I've been a soldier for ten years now, and I've seen a lot of terrible things. I've seen people killed, and I've killed people myself. I've seen friends and comrades die, and I've had to bury them. I've seen innocent civilians caught in the crossfire, and I've helped to rebuild homes and schools that have been destroyed by war.

I was born into a family of werewolves. My father was a werewolf and my mother was a human. I was raised to be a proud werewolf and to protect my pack. I joined the military to serve my country and to protect my pack. I have served in many wars and have been a part of many great battles. I am a proud werewolf and I will continue to serve my pack and my country."
