The Fiersome Merchant devil told me about their life as a merchant. They said that they enjoyed the challenge of bargaining and haggling with customers, and that they loved the feeling of satisfaction when they managed to get a good deal. They also said that they liked the independence that comes with being a merchant, and that they enjoyed being their own boss.
