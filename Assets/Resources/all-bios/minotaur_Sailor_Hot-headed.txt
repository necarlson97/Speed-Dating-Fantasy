I was born on the island of Minos and raised in the labyrinth. As a young minotaur, I was always getting into fights and getting into trouble. One day, I was caught stealing food from the king's table. The king was so angry that he sent me to work in the mines as punishment. I worked in the mines for years, until one day I met a hot-headed sailor. He told me about the wide open sea and the adventures that could be had on it. I was so fascinated by his stories that I decided to leave the mines and join him on his ship. I've been sailing the seas ever since, and I've never been happier."I'm a Hot-headed Sailor minotaur and I love it! I get to travel the world and see new places, meet new people, and experience new cultures. I love the excitement and adventure of it all. It's definitely not for everyone, but it's perfect for me."I grew up on the coast of Minotauria, where my family ran a small fishing business. I always loved the sea and dreamed of becoming a sailor. When I was old enough, I left home and joined the Minotaurian navy. I quickly rose through the ranks, and eventually became one of the most respected sailors in the fleet.

My life changed one day when our ship was attacked by a band of pirates. We fought bravely, but were outnumbered and outgunned. I was the only one who made it off the ship alive.

I was adrift for weeks, until I was finally rescued by a passing merchant vessel. I vowed then and there to get revenge on the pirates who had killed my crew and destroyed my life. I spent the next few years tracking them down, and finally caught up to them on a small island in the middle of the ocean.

I killed every last one of them, and then I burned their ship to the ground. I still sail the seas to this day, but I always keep one eye open for any sign of piracy. I'll never rest until every last pirate is dead."
