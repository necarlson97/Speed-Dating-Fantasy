I was born in Transylvania in 1760. I was turned into a vampire in 1810. I've been a vampire for over 200 years. I've been a teacher for almost as long. I've taught many students, both human and vampire. I love teaching, it's my passion. I want to teach forever."

I was born in 17th century Transylvania and have been a vampire for over 400 years. I've seen a lot in my lifetime, and I'm not sure if there's anything that can surprise me anymore. I've been a teacher for most of my life, and I enjoy helping others learn and grow. I'm also a bit of a historian, and I love learning about different cultures and their customs.

I was born in Transylvania and have lived for centuries. I am a vampire and I teach at a local university. I love the night life and the blood of my victims. I am feared by many, but I enjoy the company of my students and the challenge of teaching them."
