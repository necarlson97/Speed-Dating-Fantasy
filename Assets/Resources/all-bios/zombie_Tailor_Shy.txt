I was born in a small town in the middle of nowhere. My parents were poor, so I had to start working at a young age. I was a shy child, so I became a tailor. I worked hard and eventually became a master tailor. I married a beautiful woman and we had two children. Life was good.

But then the zombie apocalypse happened. My wife and children were killed and I was turned into a zombie. Now I spend my days shuffling around, searching for brains to eat. I sometimes think about my old life, but it's hard to remember who I used to be.

I used to be a human tailor. I designed clothes for a living. I was shy and introverted, but I loved my job. I was good at it too.

But then the zombie apocalypse happened. I was infected and turned into one of the undead. Now I just shamble around, searching for brains to eat. I don't really enjoy it, but it's what I have to do to survive.

I miss my old life. I miss being able to create beautiful things. But at least I'm still able to use my skills to make new clothes for my fellow zombies. It's not the same

I used to be a tailor, but I'm a zombie now. I don't really remember much about my life before I turned, but I do know that I enjoyed sewing and making clothes. I miss being able to do that, but I'm not really sure what I miss most about my old life."
