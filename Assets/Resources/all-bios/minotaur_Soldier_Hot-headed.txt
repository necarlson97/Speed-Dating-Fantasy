I was born to fight. It's all I've ever known. I was raised on tales of battle and glory, of how we minotaurs are the greatest warriors in all the land. So when I came of age, I enlisted in the army.

"I've been fighting ever since. I've seen more than my fair share of combat, and I've always come out on top. I'm not saying I'm the best fighter out there, but I'm damn good. And I always put my all into every battle.

"Some people say I'm too hotheaded, that I let my emotions get the better of me in battle. But I say that's what makes me a great warrior. When I'm in the thick of battle, I'm not thinking about strategy or tactics, I'm just focused on winning. And that's what always gets me through."I was born to a family of soldiers, so it was only natural that I would become one myself. I joined the army as soon as I was old enough and I've been serving ever since. I've seen a lot of combat over the years, and I've come to love the thrill of battle. There's nothing quite like the feeling of fighting for your life and coming out victorious.

"I'm known for being a bit of a hothead, but that's just because I care so passionately about what I do. I would do anything to protect my comrades and my country. I'm proud to be a soldier, and I'll keep fighting for as long as I can."I enlisted in the army when I was just a young bull. I was eager to serve my country and defend my home. I was assigned to the front lines, and I saw a lot of action. I was wounded several times, but I always managed to get back up and fight on. I'm a hot-headed bull, and I always charge into battle without thinking. But that's just the way I am. I'm not afraid of anything, and I'll fight to the death to protect my home and my family."
