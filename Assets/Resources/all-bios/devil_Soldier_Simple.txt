I was born a poor boy in a small town. I joined the army as soon as I could and I've been fighting ever since. I've seen a lot of death and destruction, but I'm still here. I guess you could say I'm a simple soldier devil."

I was born a poor boy in a small village. I joined the army to fight for my country. I've been in the army for 10 years. I've seen a lot of death and destruction. I've been in many battles and I've killed many people. I'm a simple soldier, but I'm a devil in the eyes of my enemies. I'm a good man, but I'm a devil in the eyes of my friends. I'm a simple man, but I'm a devil in the eyes of the world."

I was born a poor man's son
I was raised in the country
I joined the army when I was young
I've fought in many battles
I've killed many men
I'm a simple soldier devil
I'm just doing what I'm told
I don't know why I'm fighting
I don't know why I'm killing
I don't know why I'm living
I'm just a simple soldier devil
