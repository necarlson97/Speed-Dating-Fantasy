I was born into a small orcish village in the middle of nowhere. My parents were farmers, and I was their only child. Growing up, I was always a shy kid. I never really talked to anyone outside of my family. When I was old enough, I joined the village militia to help protect my home from raiders. I eventually became the captain of the militia, and then the mayor of the village. I've been the mayor for years now, and I love my job. I'm always looking for ways to make my village a better place to live. I'm also always looking to help out my fellow villagers,



I was born into a large orc family in the heart of the Shy Mayor Orc clan. My early life was spent learning the ways of our people and honing my skills in combat. When I reached adulthood, I was elected to be the clan's new leader.

Since becoming the Shy Mayor, I have worked tirelessly to improve the lives of my people. We have built new homes, started new businesses, and made peace with our neighbors. Our clan is thriving, and I am proud to be their leader.

I'm the mayor of this village. I'm shy and don't talk to many people, but I'm happy with my life here."
