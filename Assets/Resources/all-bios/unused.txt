 I am always on the lookout for new and exciting opportunities, and I am always willing to take risks. 

 I'm not very good at socializing, so I don't talk to people much. I'm a bit of a loner, but I like my work.

 I'm one of the best in the business, and I've been doing it for years. I've built some of the most impressive structures in the world, and I'm not done yet. I'll continue to build until the day I die.

 I don't really have much of a life outside of my duty - I don't mind though.

 I've seen and done things that would make your hair stand on end! I've been to every corner of the world, and I've had more adventures than you could ever imagine. I'm not afraid of anything, and I'm always ready for a fight. I'm the toughest, meanest, and most feared sailor elf around, and I wouldn't have it any other way!"
