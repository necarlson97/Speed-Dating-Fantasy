I was born at sea and raised on the waves. I've been a sailor since I was a young zombie, and I've seen many things in my years on the high seas. I've seen shipwrecks and storms, and I've fought in many battles. I've seen my share of death and destruction, but I've also seen the beauty of the world. I've sailed to many different places, and I've seen many different things. I'm a Dasdardly Sailor Zombie, and I'm proud of it."

I was a sailor, back in the day. I sailed the seven seas, looking for adventure. I had some good times, and I had some bad times. But I always kept my head up and kept sailing.

One day, I was out on the open sea, and I was attacked by a group of zombies. They took me down and turned me into one of them. Now I spend my days wandering the seas, looking for other sailors to eat. I'm not sure what else there is to do, but it's all I can do. I hope one day I'll find a way to break free from this

I was a sailor in the Royal Navy. I served on several ships, including the HMS Victory. I was wounded in battle and died of my wounds. I was buried at sea."
