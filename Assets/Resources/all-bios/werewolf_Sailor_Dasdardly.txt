I was born in a small town in the middle of nowhere. My parents were poor, and we didn't have much. I joined the navy as soon as I could, and I've been sailing ever since. I've seen a lot of strange things out there, and I've killed my fair share of monsters. But nothing has prepared me for this."

I was born in the year of the dog, so that makes me a Dasdardly Sailor werewolf. I grew up in the small town of Wolfville, in the state of Maine. My parents were werewolves, so I always knew that I would be one too.

I joined the navy when I was eighteen, and that's where I got the nickname 'Dasdardly'. I was always getting into trouble, and my superiors never knew what to do with me. Eventually, they just gave up and started calling me by that name.

I've been sailing the seven seas for the past ten

I was born in the month of the Wolf, under a full moon. I grew up in a pack of werewolves, and we would run and hunt together under the light of the moon. I always felt a connection to the moon, and when I was old enough, I decided to join the navy.

I was stationed on a ship that sailed around the world, and I would often look up at the moon and think of my pack back home. I missed them, but I knew that I was doing something important. I was helping to protect my country, and I was proud of that.

One night, while
