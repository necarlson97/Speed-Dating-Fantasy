My life is all about teaching young orcs how to be fearsome warriors. I love what I do and wouldn't trade it for anything.

I was born into a clan of orcs who were warriors and hunters. I was taught how to fight and hunt at a young age. When I was old enough, I joined the clan's military and fought in many battles. After years of fighting, I rose through the ranks and became a fearsome warrior.

Now, I teach young orcs how to fight and hunt. I hope to instill in them the same fierce passion for battle that I have. I want them to be the best warriors they can be, so that one day they can take my place and defend our clan."

I was born into a clan of orcish raiders. I grew up learning how to fight and pillage. When I came of age, I joined my clan on many raids. I was fierce and ruthless, and I quickly rose through the ranks.

One day, we came across a human village. The villagers were terrified of us, but they offered us a large sum of gold to spare their lives. My clan leader ordered me to take the gold and kill the villagers anyway. I did as I was ordered, but I felt sick afterwards. I realized then that I didn't want to be a raider anymore.
