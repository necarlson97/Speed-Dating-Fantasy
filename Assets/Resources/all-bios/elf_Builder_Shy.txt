I was born in the forest and raised by my parents. I grew up playing in the trees and making things out of leaves and sticks. When I was old enough, I started helping my parents build houses in the forest. I learned how to use a hammer and saw, and I loved the smell of fresh-cut lumber.

Eventually, I left the forest and started my own business as a builder. I've worked on all sorts of projects, from small cottages to large castles. I'm always striving to improve my craft, and I take a lot of pride in my work.

I'm a shy person

I'm a shy builder, I like to build things in my spare time. I don't really talk to people much, but I like to listen to them. I'm a bit of a loner, but I'm happy with that. I'm content with my life and I enjoy doing what I do."

I'm a shy builder, I don't talk much because I'm not very good at it. I like to build things, so I guess that's why I'm a builder. I don't really have any friends, but that's okay because I like spending time by myself. I'm not really sure what else to say, but thanks for talking to me."
