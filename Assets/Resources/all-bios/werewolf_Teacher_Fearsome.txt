The Fearsome Teacher werewolf told me about their life as a teacher. They said that it can be difficult at times, but they love it. They told me about some of the challenges they face, such as dealing with difficult students or managing a large class. But they said that ultimately they love teaching and wouldn't trade it for anything.

I was born in the small town of Wolf Creek, Montana. When I was five, my parents were killed by a hunter who tracked them down. I was raised by my grandparents, who instilled in me a love of learning. I went to college and got my teaching degree, and then I came back to Wolf Creek to teach at the elementary school.

I've been teaching for fifteen years now, and I love it. I've seen a lot of changes in Wolf Creek over the years, but one thing remains the same: it's a great place to raise a family.

I'm a werewolf, and

I was born in the forest, raised by my pack. When I was old enough, I began to teach the young ones how to hunt and how to survive in the forest. I love teaching others and watching them grow and learn. It's my passion."
