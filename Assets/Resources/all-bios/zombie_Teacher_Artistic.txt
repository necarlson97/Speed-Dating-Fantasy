I was an art teacher before the zombie apocalypse. I loved my job and I loved my students. I miss them every day."



My life used to be all about art. I loved going to art shows and teaching classes. But now, ever since I turned into a zombie, all I can think about is brains. Brains, brains, brains. I crave them all the time. It's really hard to teach art when all you can think about is eating brains.

I was an art teacher before the outbreak. I loved my job, but when the zombies came, everything changed. I had to fight to survive. I've seen things that I never thought I would see, and I've done things that I never thought I would do. But I'm still here, and I'm still teaching. I may not be in a classroom anymore, but I'm still teaching people. I'm teaching them how to survive."
