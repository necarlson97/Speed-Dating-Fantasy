The Wise Musician orc told me about their life as a musician. They said that they loved making music, and that it was their passion. They also said that they loved to teach others about music, and that they enjoyed helping others learn to play instruments.

I am a musician, and I have been one for many years. I have seen many things and heard many stories. I have also seen many things that I cannot unsee, and I have heard many stories that I wish I had never heard. But, I would not trade my life for anything, for I would not be who I am today without my music."

They said that they had been able to travel to many different places and meet many different people through their music. They said that they had also been able to help others through their music, and that they were grateful for that.
