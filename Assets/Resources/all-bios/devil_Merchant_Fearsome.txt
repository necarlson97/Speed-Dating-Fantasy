I was born in the fiery pits of the Nine Hells, and ever since then I've been climbing up the ranks of the merchant devils. I've been cheated, lied to, and stolen from, but I always come out on top in the end. I'm the most feared merchant in all the Nine Hells, and I wouldn't have it any other way."



The Fearsome Merchant devil told me that they had been alive for centuries, and that they had seen and done everything there was to see and do. They told me that they had once been a mortal, but had made a deal with a powerful being to become a devil in exchange for immortality.

The Fearsome Merchant told me that they enjoyed their life as a devil, and that they would never trade it for anything. They told me that they were able to help people by giving them the things they needed, and that they enjoyed being able to do that.



The Fearsome Merchant devil told me about their life as a merchant. They said that they had to travel to different planes to sell their wares, and that they often had to deal with dangerous customers. They also said that they sometimes had to bargain with other devils to get the best prices for their goods.
