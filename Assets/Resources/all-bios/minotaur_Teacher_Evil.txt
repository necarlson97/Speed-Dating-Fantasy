I was born in the dark, dank depths of the labyrinth. I was raised to be a teacher of minotaurs, and I enjoyed every moment of it. But one day, something happened that changed everything.

One of my students, a young minotaur named Thrax, showed a natural talent for magic. I taught him everything I knew, and he quickly surpassed me. He became obsessed with power, and began to use his magic for evil.

I tried to stop him, but he was too strong. He cast a powerful spell that trapped me in this body. Now, I am nothing more than a mindless beast, forced to do his bidding.

I hate Thrax with every fiber of my being, and I will do anything to see him destroyed. But until that day comes, I will continue to serve him, and carry out his evil plans."I'm a Evil Teacher minotaur. I was born to be evil. I love being evil. It's what I do. I'm also a teacher, and I love teaching evil students how to be evil like me. It's the best job in the world."

My life is pretty simple. I teach during the day and spend my evenings and weekends relaxing. I don't have much of a social life, but I'm content with my life the way it is.
