I am a shy merchant. I sell goods and services in my local community. I am a hard worker and I enjoy what I do. I am also a bit of a loner, so I don't mind spending time by myself. I like to read and I enjoy spending time outdoors. I am a peaceful person and I don't like violence. I am honest and I have a strong work ethic. I am loyal and I have a strong sense of duty. I am also a bit of a perfectionist. I am always striving to improve my skills and to provide the best possible service to my customers."

I'm a merchant, I travel around selling things. I'm shy, so I don't talk to people much. I just keep to myself and mind my own business."

I am a merchant, I trade in goods and services. I am shy by nature, so I don't talk much. I live a simple life, I don't have much, but I am happy with what I have. I am content to live my life in peace and quiet, and I hope to continue doing so for many years to come."
