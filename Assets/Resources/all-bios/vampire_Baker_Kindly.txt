I was born in the early 1800s in Transylvania. When I was younger, I was very interested in the dark arts and began practicing blood magic. This led to me becoming a vampire. I've been a vampire for over 200 years now. I try to stick to feeding on animals, but sometimes I do crave human blood. I try to stick to hunting in rural areas where I won't be noticed, but sometimes I do slip up and feed on people in urban areas. I try to be careful, but it's hard to resist the temptation sometimes."

The Kindly Baker vampire is a creature of the night, they live in the shadows and hunt for their prey. They are often seen as a dark creature, but they can be kind and loving. They are often misunderstood and feared by humans."



The vampire told me that they had been alive for centuries, and had seen many things during their long life. They said that they enjoyed the company of other vampires, and often spent their nights talking and laughing together. They told me that they liked to drink blood, but only from willing donors. They said that they were careful not to take too much, as they didn't want to harm anyone. They told me that they were grateful for the gift of life, and that they would never take it for granted.
