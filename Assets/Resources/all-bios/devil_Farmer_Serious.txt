I'm a Serious Farmer devil. I live on a farm and take care of the animals. I'm also responsible for the crops. I have to make sure that everything is healthy and growing. It's a lot of work, but I love it. I'm also a bit of a handyman, so I help out around the farm when I can. I'm always busy, but I wouldn't have it any other way."



The Serious Farmer devil told me that they have been farming for a very long time. They said that it is a lot of work, but they enjoy it. They also told me that they are always trying to improve their methods and learn new things.



I met a Serious Farmer devil, they talked about their life:

"I'm a Serious Farmer devil. I work hard every day to ensure that my crops are healthy and productive. I take great pride in my work, and I enjoy being able to provide food for my community. It's a demanding job, but it's also very rewarding. I'm glad I chose to become a farmer!"
